stacks-issues
=============

This is a supplimentary online space for a [graduate course on Algebraic Stacks][stacks], taught by [Danny Krashen][home] during Fall 2014 at the [University of Georgia][UGA], [department of mathematics][ugamath].

Our main source material is [Martin Olsson's][martin] book in progress on Algebraic Spaces and Stacks. We are using this particular github repository's issue tracker system for the members of the class to communicate with each other about questions about the text, and to keep a look out for typographical errors in the book's preliminary draft.
